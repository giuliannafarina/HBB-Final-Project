The hormone regulates libido, bone mass, muscle mass and strength, fat distribution, and of course mood. It also regulates the production of red blood cells and sperm. A significant increase of the hormone begins during puberty, and as the male body gets older, testosterone production becomes a steady decline. High and low levels of testosterone have proven to affect males mental and physical health. The video, <em>What is testosterone? </em>gives a in-depth description on the hormone, and how it is distributed throughout the body. </p><p>&zwj;</p><h4>Video: <em>What is testosterone?</em></h4><figure style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6jHYOqYqj-A" title=""></iframe></div></figure></div><div class="divider grey"></div></div></div><div id="process" class="section wf-section"><div class="w-container"><h2 class="heading"><strong>Aggression </strong></h2><div class="w-richtext"><h4>Developing Aggression</h4><p>In psychology, anger views aggression as a secondary emotion. This means that anger can be easily accessed and a primal response. When someone expresses anger, they are also expressing other emotions such as frustration, irritability, abandonment, and loneliness. Aggression is usually divided into two categories. Impulsive aggression is directly stemmed from emotions that you develop in a situation. Instrumental aggression or cognitive aggression is from intent, with a desire or goal in mind. The two ways aggression is expressed is physical and verbal.</p><h4>The Effects on the Body</h4><p>When a human expresses anger, a biological response of cortisol and adrenaline are released in huge amounts. Aggression is one of the strongest emotions, and effects the body in many ways. Psychotherapist John Sovec explains how repeated anger can do physical harm to our bodies. When asked what anger does to the body, he explains, “Anger can absolutely harm you or even kill you due to the wear and tear it has on your body. When we are angry, it takes three seconds for our body to go into full fight or flight mode, which means our body is ready to take on an attack. When angry, we stay in this state for approximately 30 minutes each time we are mad throughout the day. This creates exhaustion and wears on our bodies causing immune systems to decrease, which means we become sicker more often. Having our body in attack mode can increase blood pressure and rapid heart beating, which can ultimately cause heart attacks or a stroke. Many people report feeling exhaustion and headaches when having anger issues. While anger is an extremely important emotion to have as it alerts us when something is wrong and change needs to happen, health-wise it can be dangerous if it occurs frequently and/or lasts for too long.” Anger is exhausting for the human body, which can lead to a weaker immune system and greater risk of becoming susceptible to sickness overtime. Some other physical illnesses include high blood pressure, migraines, and gastritis.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h4>Video: <em>The Science of Anger</em></h4><figure style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_5DU5opOFk" title="THE SCIENCE OF ANGER"></iframe></div></figure></div><div class="divider grey"></div></div></div><div id="process" class="section wf-section"><div class="w-container"><h2 class="heading"><strong>Dominance</strong></h2><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62f54872cea3732824f83681/62f58e4d87ee5b1b5e3b0afb_angryman.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-4"><div class="w-richtext"><h4>An Overview of Dominance</h4><p>A conceptualized theory called the dominance behavioral system (DBS) is a biologically based system which guides dominance motivation, dominant and subordinate behavior, and responsivity to perceptions of power and subordination. A growing body of research suggests that problems with the DBS are evident across a broad range of psychopathologies. We begin by describing psychological, social, and biological correlates of the DBS. Extensive research suggests that externalizing disorders, mania-proneness, and narcissistic traits are related to heightened dominance motivation and behaviors. Mania and narcissistic traits also appear related to inflated self-perceptions of power. Beginning in early childhood, humans are put in situations in which they can assert dominance. Those with high dominance motivation are more likely to engage in dominance behaviors. Human research in dominance is usually explored in tow different ways. The first research type focuses on behaviors that are enacted to enhance power, without considering the success in achieving the said goal or action. The other explains that dominant behaviors are not confined to competitive behaviors, but also include behaviors that can be aimed at gaining approval to superiors and assertiveness. Paul Gilbert explained in his research that dominant behaviors are designed to promote social status and inclusion, including efforts to enhance how much one is liked, valued, respected, and wanted.</p></div><div class="divider grey"></div></div></div><div id="process" class="section wf-section"><div class="w-container"><h2 class="heading"><strong>Robert Sapolsky and his Research</strong></h2><div class="w-richtext"><p>Robert Sapolsky is a highly regarded neuroendocrinologist. He has completed extensive research with many different hormones, and how they affect our bodies and behaviors. With a main focus on stress, Sapolsky has spent more than three decades studying the physiological effects of stress on health. In a lecture, Sapolsky taught the influence testosterone has on our behavior. On of the specific behaviors he looked at was anger, explaining that testosterone is not the reason for aggressive behavior. The truth is that although it is not the cause, testosterone can definitely amplify aggression. </p><h4>Video: <em>How Testosterone Influences Behavior</em></h4><figure style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpdNEd8fWcw" title="Robert Sapolsky - How testosterone influences behavior"></iframe></div></figure></div><div class="divider grey"></div></div></div><div id="process" class="section wf-section"><div class="w-container"><h2 class="heading"><strong>Nature vs. Nurture Discussion</strong></h2><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62f54872cea3732824f83681/62f590b7791f0a473961345c_naturenurture.png" loading="lazy" width="212" alt="" class="image-3"><div class="w-richtext"><p>The dispute between nature and nurture is a long-standing one. An aspect of this would be whether aggression is driven by our biological make-up or by the way society has shaped us. Aggression is an attractive trait to some extent, according to some psychologists, as it suggests that an individual is powerful and protective. However, abnormal aggression can lead to personality disorders and other illnesses that may have serious consequences to the individual and to society. The question is whether abnormal anger is due to our genetics or if it is due to the way we are brought up and what we experience.</p><h4>The Nature</h4><p>In support of nature, biological psychologists have done a lot of research into the human brain revealing parts such as the pre-frontal cortex and the limbic system which are scientifically proven to be involved in the process of anger. The pre-frontal cortex is involved with emotions and has high levels of synapses with neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. It regulates behavior and governs social interaction. Research has been done where psychologists have taken many brain-damage case studies and found that when the pre-frontal cortex is damaged, the individual can become very impulsive, impatient and aggressive which clearly shows that abnormal anger is somewhat influenced by the pre-frontal cortex.&nbsp;</p><h4>The Nurture</h4><p>In support of nurture, many psychologists argue that anger issues surface by the way we are influenced by the environment, the way we are brought up and the way we have experienced certain events in our lives. Our role models, such as our parents, heavily influence what we become as a person. For example, violent and aggressive role models and parents would result in the individual admiring violence and aggression and therefore copying the actions provided by their role models. This is proven by the social-learning theory. The influence that our role models have on us drastically changes who we are as a person.</p></div><h4>Discussion</h4><p>Research suggests that, in general, just like so many aspects of personality, we are born with a range of potentiality. For example, our genetics may determine the range of our potential intelligence, but studies have increasingly emphasized that nurture plays a major role in influencing whether intelligence settles at the lower or the higher end of that potentiality. Consequently, a child will establish a degree of intelligence consistent with functioning at the higher end of his potential when he receives cognitive stimulation, is encouraged to be curious, and develops verbal as well as visual-motor skills. By contrast, a child born with the same potential but with minimal stimulation and encouragement may function at the lower level of his potential.</p><div class="divider grey"></div></div></div><div id="process" class="section wf-section"><div class="w-container"><h2 class="heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><h4 class="heading-2">The Correlation of Testosterone and our Behaviors</h4><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62f54872cea3732824f83681/62f5b6a3cea3733515fe1b50_emotions%20behavior.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 300px" width="300" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62f54872cea3732824f83681/62f5b6a3cea3733515fe1b50_emotions%20behavior-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62f54872cea3732824f83681/62f5b6a3cea3733515fe1b50_emotions%20behavior-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62f54872cea3732824f83681/62f5b6a3cea3733515fe1b50_emotions%20behavior-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62f54872cea3732824f83681/62f5b6a3cea3733515fe1b50_emotions%20behavior-p-1600.png 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62f54872cea3732824f83681/62f5b6a3cea3733515fe1b50_emotions%20behavior-p-2000.png 2000w" alt="" class="image-2"><p>Through extensive research, it has been shown that an increase in testosterone can increase aggression and dominance. Since men have higher testosterone levels than women, this could be why they express these behaviors. Testosterone may have an effect by increasing activity in the amygdala, particularly when we are being threatened, leading to reactive aggression. Testosterone helps our body to prepare the body to fight when we are motivated to deal with a social threat by the increasing activity in the amygdala.</p><div class="divider grey"></div></div></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=62f54872cea3732824f83681" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="main.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>
